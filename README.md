With a background in C/C++/Go development, 5 years ago I started redirecting my focus towards the front-end and towards building beautiful interfaces, and I've been learning, evolving, and perfecting my craft every since.

I'm a polyglot, and I've fiddled with a plethora of programming languages over the years, including Haskell, Rust, and the Lisp(s).

My most recent obsession is centered around dynamic languages, and in particular [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)).

Currently building a world-class website as a front-end developer [at Metafy](https://github.com/metafy-gg).
