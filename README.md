With a background in Go/C/C++ development, 5 years ago I started redirecting my focus towards the front-end and mastering the art of building beautiful interfaces & I have been learning, evolving, and perfecting my craft ever since.

I'm a polyglot and I've fiddled with a plethora of programming languages over the years, including Haskell, Rust, and the Lisp(s).

My most recent obsession is centered around dynamic languages, and in particular [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)).
